# Capture package: contract notes

Decisions taken where the spec ("Capture and Walk", section 10) was ambiguous. The
parallel work packages (C2-C9, S1-S3) code against these. Change them only together
with every consumer.

## Model (C1, `capture/model.py`)

- **Id spaces.** A node's *id* is its ref once refs are applied, else its canonical
  key. `Index.nodes` is keyed by id, and ids are what `UNode.parent/children/window`,
  every `Tree`, and `Index.reading` hold. `Index.by_key` maps canonical keys and
  aliases (`w:<udid>`, legacy `compose:<id>` when unique) to ids.
  `build_index()` (C4) returns a key-space index (`ref=None`).
  `apply_refs(ix, refmap)` is `model.remap_ids(ix, refmap)`, where refmap maps keys to refs.
  `remap_ids` also sets `UNode.ref`.
- **Node links inside facets** use ids and must sit under a name in
  `model.REF_FIELDS`, so that `remap_ids` rewrites them:
  - `a11y.labeled_by/label_for/traversal/traversal_before/traversal_after`
  - `compose.slots`
  - `slot.sem`

  To add a new link, extend the table. `rebound_of` names an old capture's ref and
  is never remapped.
- **Window roots.** The spec's "View node flagged `window:true`" is `UNode.z`: an int
  on window roots, None elsewhere. `UNode.is_window` is `z is not None`.
  `UNode.window` holds the window root's id; a root points at itself.
- **Primary tree.** `parent`, `children` and `depth` place a node in its primary
  tree: `ui` for view, compose and a11y nodes, `slots` for slot nodes. Slot nodes
  take `window` from the semantics node they link to, and it is None when they are
  unlinked.
- **Keys.**
  - `slot:<acv>:<hash8>`, where hash8 is `blake2s(anchor, digest_size=4).hexdigest()`.
  - The ID1 fallback key is `a11y:path:<rootUdid>:<0.i.j>`, where the path starts
    with `0` for the root.
  - Negative ints are allowed, e.g. `a11y:<host>:-1` for a View's own node.
- **`Issue`**: `{id, sev, evidence, conf}`. `conf` defaults to `exact`. The rule
  catalog in C7 validates ids; the model accepts any id.
- **`LineageState` lives in `model.py`.** refs.py (C5) and store.py (C2) import it
  from there. `lineage_file_name(serial, package)` gives the file name, with
  path-hostile characters replaced.
- **`CaptureMeta`.**
  - Field order follows section 10. Everything after `lineage` has a default.
    `agent_build` (spec 3.1) is appended after `schema`.
  - `options` is a `CaptureOptions`, written to JSON as a dict.
  - `lineage` is a `(serial, package)` tuple, written to JSON as
    `{"serial","package"}`.
  - `set_facet()` validates the status vocabulary.
- **`RawCapture`.**
  - An unfetched facet is `b""` for the required ones and `None` for `slots` and
    `a11y_render`. `meta.facets` says why.
  - On-disk paths come only from `RAW_FILES`, `shot_file(root)` and `skp_file(root)`.
    Use `RawCapture.files()` and `RawCapture.from_files()`; the store (C2) and
    fetch (C3) must not invent paths.
- **`index.jsonl(.gz)`.**
  - `index_to_jsonl(ix, compress=False)` writes a header line, then one node per
    line in pre-order.
  - The header holds `index` (schema), `capture`, `count`, `trees`, `reading`,
    `diagnostics` and `aliases`.
  - `index_from_jsonl` detects gzip. It raises `ValueError` on a schema mismatch
    or truncation, and the store rebuilds the index from the raw facets when that
    happens.
  - Nodes omit fields that equal their defaults.
- **Store root.** `model.default_store_root()` implements spec 4.1. The store (C2)
  uses it for `root=None`, and Phase-0 spill files go to `<root>/spill`
  (`output.default_spill_dir()`).
- **`OpError.to_dict()`** always has `hint` (null if none). It has `candidates`
  only when given. An unknown code raises `ValueError`.
- **Test builders** live in `tests/capture_builders.py`:
  - `IndexBuilder`
  - `launcher_index()`: the spec's section 5 example (n1..n25, n301..n305)
  - `wide_index()`: 259 views
  - `big_index(n)`

  The builder's `sel` is a stand-in (`@tag` or `#rid` when unique, else the ref).
  The real `sel` is computed in C4.
